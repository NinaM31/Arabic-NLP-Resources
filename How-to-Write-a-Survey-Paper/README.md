# Learning How To Write a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)

Research is an incremental acquisition of specific skills, distinct from software development or technical documentation. To conduct research effectively, you must navigate through a series of structured phases. This repository aims to guide new researchers through the process of writing a systematic literature review.

## Phases of a Systematic Literature Review

1.  **Topic Selection:** Defining your research question.
2.  **Information Resource Collection:** Gathering relevant literature.
3.  **Evaluation of Information Resources:** Assessing the quality and relevance of sources.
4.  **Annotated Bibliography:** Summarizing and evaluating individual sources.
5.  **In-Depth Evaluation (Critical Appraisal):** Analyzing selected studies in detail.
6.  **Literature Review Writing:** Synthesizing findings and presenting your review.

## 1. Topic Selection: Defining Your Research Question

Choosing a research topic is the foundation of your SLR.

* **Consult Experts:** Seek guidance from advisors or explore online forums like [Kaggle Forums](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [AI Stack Exchange](https://ai.stackexchange.com/).
* **Explore Existing Surveys:** Reading surveys can reveal research gaps and potential areas of interest.
* **Follow a Structured Approach:**

    </p>
* **Refining Your Research Question:**
    * Ensure your question is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
    * Consider the feasibility and scope of your review.
    * Identify potential research gaps and areas where your review can contribute.

## 2. Information Resource Collection: Gathering Relevant Literature

A thorough literature search is essential for a comprehensive review.

* **Research Databases:**
    * [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)
    * [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/)
    * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/)
    * [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)
    * [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)
* **Search Strategies:**
    * **Keywords:** Identify key terms related to your research question.
    * **Boolean Operators:** Use AND, OR, and NOT to refine your search.
        * Example: `"machine learning" AND "medical imaging" NOT "cancer"`
    * **Phrase Searching:** Use quotation marks to search for exact phrases.
        * Example: `"natural language processing"`
    * **Wildcards:** Use asterisks (*) to search for variations of a word.
        * Example: `comput*` (computational, computer, computing)
    * **Citation Chainining:** A chain is formed because one resource cites another, which cites another and is cited by yet another. You can pick a survey paper and search the references they used. 
* **Types of Literature:**
    * Journal articles, conference papers, books, technical reports, and theses.
* **Reference Management:**
    * Use tools like [RefWorks](https://refworks.proquest.com/) or [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) to organize your sources. These tools help generate citations and bibliographies in various styles.
    * You can use [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) tables to gather additional information such as `"Document Type: Survey, Study, Research, Dataset ...", "Dataset Used", "Approach Used"`

## 3. Evaluation of Information Resources: Assessing Quality and Relevance

Not all collected sources will be suitable for your review.

* **Evaluation Criteria:**
    * **Author Credibility:** Assess the author's expertise and affiliations.
    * **Publication Venue:** Consider the reputation of the journal or conference.
    * **Publication Date:** Ensure the source is recent enough.
    * **Methodology:** Evaluate the soundness of the research methods

## 4. Annotated Bibliography: Summarizing and Evaluating Individual Sources

After evaluating the initial quality and relevance of your collected resources (Phase 3), the next step is to create an annotated bibliography. This is more than just a list of citations; each entry includes a summary and a critical assessment of the source. This detailed analysis helps you deeply understand each paper, assess its contribution to your topic, and prepare for the synthesis required in the final literature review (Phase 6).

For each resource you decide to include after the initial evaluation, your annotation should systematically address the following aspects:

1.  **Author Information:**
    * Briefly note the main author's credentials, affiliation, and expertise. Is the author a recognized expert in this specific field? Understanding the author's background can provide context for the paper's perspective and potential biases.

2.  **Main Idea/Purpose:**
    * Clearly state the central argument, research question(s), or objective of the paper. What specific problem does the paper aim to address or investigate? What is its core thesis or hypothesis?

3.  **Intended Audience and Required Background:**
    * Identify who the paper is written for (e.g., experts in a niche subfield, generalists, practitioners). What level of prior knowledge (e.g., specific theories, technical skills, statistical understanding) is assumed for the reader to fully grasp the content? This helps you gauge if the paper aligns with your own understanding and the scope of your review.

4.  **Summary of Main Content:**
    * Concisely summarize the key sections of the paper. This typically includes:
        * **Methodology/Approach:** How was the research conducted? What methods, techniques, or frameworks were used? If it's an empirical study, describe the data collection and analysis. If it's a theoretical paper, outline the main line of reasoning.
        * **Key Findings/Arguments:** What were the main results or points presented? What evidence supports them?

5.  **Conclusion:**
    * Summarize the authors' main conclusions, outcomes, or takeaways as presented in the paper. What answers did they provide to their research questions? What are the implications of their findings according to them?

6.  **Your Critical Assessment (Opinions and Limitations):**
    * This is your evaluation. Critically assess the paper's strengths and weaknesses. Consider:
        * **Strengths:** What does the paper do well? Is the methodology sound? Are the arguments logical and well-supported? Is it innovative?
        * **Limitations/Weaknesses:** Are there flaws in the methodology? Is the scope too narrow or too broad? Are there potential biases? Are the conclusions fully supported by the evidence? What questions remain unanswered?
        * **Overall Judgement:** Provide your brief assessment of the paper's contribution and rigor.

7.  **Usefulness and Relevance to Your Review:**
    * Explicitly state *why* this resource is useful for *your specific SLR*. How does it help answer *your* research question? Does it provide key definitions, background information, specific data points, a novel perspective, or evidence supporting/refuting a particular aspect of your topic?

8.  **Relation to Other References:**
    * How does this paper connect with other sources you've reviewed? Does it support, contradict, expand upon, or refine findings from other studies? Does it fill a gap identified in previous literature? Noting these connections helps you start building the narrative for your final literature review synthesis.

## 5. In-Depth Evaluation (Critical Appraisal): Previous LR Evlauation
Pick a single survey and conduct a in-depth evaluation using the following criteria:
1. **Research Question/ Objective**
Assess the clarity and appropriateness of the research question or objective. Consider if the literature review clearly articulates its purpose and scope

2. **Search Strategy**
Evaluate the rigor and comprehensiveness of the search strategy used to identify relevant literature. Consider if appropriate databases, keywords, and inclusion/exclusion criteria were employed to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased selection of sources.

3. **Inclusion Criteria**
Assess the criteria used to select studies for inclusion in the literature review. Consider if the criteria are clearly defined and if they are relevant to the research question or objective. Evaluate if the inclusion criteria were consistently applied.
 
4. **Quality Assessment**
Evaluate the method used to assess the quality of the included studies. Consider if appropriate quality assessment tools or frameworks were used to evaluate the reliability and validity of the selected studies.

5. **Synthesis of Findings**
Assess how the literature review synthesizes the findings from the included studies. Consider if the synthesis is systematic, organized, and provides a clear overview of the current state of knowledge on the research topic. Evaluate if the review identifies trends, patterns, or gaps in the literature.

6. **Critical Analysis**
Evaluate the level of critical analysis applied to the included studies. Consider if the literature review goes beyond a simple summary of the findings and provides a thoughtful analysis and interpretation of the literature. Look for evidence of the reviewer's ability to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the studies.

7. **Coherence and Structure**
Assess the coherence and structure of the literature review. Consider if the review is well-organized, with clear sections and headings. Evaluate if there is a logical flow of ideas and if the review effectively connects the key concepts and themes.

8. **Clarity of Writing**
Evaluate the clarity and readability of the literature review. Consider if the writing is clear, concise, and free from grammatical or spelling errors. Assess if the review effectively communicates complex ideas in an accessible manner

9. **Currency and Relevance**
Assess the currency and relevance of the literature sources included in the review. Consider if the review includes recent and up-to-date studies that reflect the current state of the field. Evaluate if the included literature is directly relevant to the research question or objective.

10. **Contribution and Implications**
Evaluate the overall contribution and implications of the literature review. Consider if the review adds value to the existing body of knowledge, identifies research gaps, or provides recommendations for future research or practice.

## 6. Literature Review Writing
This is where all your hard work comes together, transforming individual summaries and critical appraisals into a cohesive and insightful narrative. Think of your annotated bibliography (Phase 4) and in-depth evaluations (Phase 5) as individual puzzle pieces. Now, it's time to connect these pieces, arranging them logically to reveal the full picture and tell a compelling story about your research topic. You'll identify themes, trends, and contradictions, showing how existing knowledge fits together and where the gaps lie.
